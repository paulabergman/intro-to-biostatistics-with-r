 ## Let's get started
 
 In the box below you can see the instructions for the exercise. On the right in the upper window you can type your code. That window is called editor. You can execute the code by pressing Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter in Mac) when the cursor is on the same line with your command. If your command is on multiple lines you must select all those rows and then Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter. When you run your commands, the results appear in the window under the editor. That window is called console.
 
 You can use R as a calculator. You can run basic mathematical operations like this: 
 
- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Exponentiation: `^`
 
 In order to understand better your own code, or in case you want to save it as an actual R script (It is possible if you have R installed in your computer.) it is good to comment on your code. That can be done by typing `#` ("hash") at the beginning of the row. Any text you type on that row will be considered as a comment. For example _Calculate the mean of these numbers: 1, 3, 8, 10, 12_ in the editor window is a comment.
 
 *** =instructions
 - Assume we have a sample of ten people from the cardiac-dataset. Their ejectionfractions (in percents) are 64, 57, 52, 37, 57, 62, 60, 57, 57 and 37.  - Calculate the mean of ejectionfraction for the sample. 
 - Calculate the standard deviation of ejectionfraction for the sample. 

 - Why did you draw a barplot for gender and histogram for age? Are the variables different from each other somehow? (You don't have to write the answer down, just think about it.)
 - Draw a histogram of the variable 'bhr' (basal heart rate) in cardiac-dataset. Can you spot any outliers?
 - Calculate the mean, the median and the standard deviation of the 'bhr'-variable in cardiac-dataset. Are the mean and the median different from each other?
 - Draw a boxplot of the variable 'chol' (cholesterol) by the variable 'gender'. Can you see any difference between genders?
 
 *** =hint
 Just revise the formulas of mean and standard deviation! Write the numbers on the console and run the lines.

 ## Barplots and histograms
 
 When taking a first look at the data it is often good to visualize the variables. This is how you get the first idea of their distributions and can spot the possible outliers (Outliers are the kind of values that are very different from the other values.)
 
*** =instructions
 - Find out how many observations does the cardiac-data contain. 
 - Find out how many observations does the diabetes-data contain.
 - Draw a barplot of the variable 'gender' in diabetes-dataset.
 - Draw a histogram of the variable 'age' in cardiac-dataset.

 *** =hint
 Checking the dimensions of the dataset is a good way to find out how many observations are there. 
 Remember to connect variables to the dataset with a '$' sign.

 cardiac<-read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulabergman/intro-to-biostatistics-with-r/master/Cardiac.txt",header=T,row.names=1)
